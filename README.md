Titanic Survival Analysis – Data Analytics Project:

 Project Overview:
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival during the Titanic disaster.
The objective of this project is to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and extract key insights using data analytics tools.

  Analysis Performed"
- Checked and handled missing values (Age, Embarked)
- Analyzed survival rate based on gender
- Studied survival trends by passenger class
- Analyzed impact of age and fare on survival
- Compared survival rates across embarkation ports

---

  Key Insights:
- Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males
- Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive
- Children had a higher chance of survival compared to adults
- Passengers who paid higher fares had better survival chances
- Passengers embarked from Cherbourg (C) showed higher survival rates

---

Conclusion:
The analysis shows that survival on the Titanic was strongly influenced by gender, passenger class, age, and ticket fare. Social and economic factors played a significant role in survival outcomes.
This project helped me improve my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and deriving insights from real-world datasets.
